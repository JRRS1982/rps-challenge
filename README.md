# Project title

Rock, Paper Scissors (RPS) is the week 3, weekend project from Makers Academy. Used to practice web application development and associated skills.

### Motivation

This project was made to develop my ability to construct a web application, another progression in my journey to become a developer. It introduces multiple new concepts and languages which i have never previously used. 

### Build status

The project is currently under construction, it may not be completed as this is a practice exercise to build myskills. 

### Task / User Stories

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors

#### Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

#### Bonus level 1: Multiplayer

Change the game so that two marketeers can play against each other ( _yes there are two of them_ ).

#### Bonus level 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard

Use the _special_ rules ( _you can find them here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock_ )

## Tech / framework used

An apple macbook was used to write code using VSCode as an editor and;

* Ruby was used as the main language.
* RSpec used for testing.
* Coverall used to check test coverage.
* Sinatra used for the server framework.
* HTML was used. 
* erb was used. 
* Capybara testing was used. 

### Code style

Rubocop 0.65.0 was used for linting and stylying the Ruby code.

### Tests

A loose TDD process was used in the development of this project, please see the attached RSpec files for details of the testing that was carried out. Currently there is 100% test coverage. 

## Installation

Ruby v 2.5.0 was used in the construction of the project, if gems were used, please find attached a gem file listing those gems for installation.

## API Reference

No API used in this project.

## How to use

You should be able to run the code via irb, which will open a port that can be navigated to in a web browser via 'local host'.

## Credits

Full credit given to Makers Academy who suggested the project.

No contributions are required at this time, as this is a training exercise.
